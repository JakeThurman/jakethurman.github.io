I like writing songs, but sometimes I'd like to be quickly inspired by rhymes without having to leave my workflow and look at another site. 
The page consistes of a single textarea for song composition and a simple request rhymes.
Rhyming words are found through an API call.
I personally still use this project to this day, (as of 2019).

This project was built quickly by expanding on the base created for my [pedalboard project](./pedalboardProject.html).
