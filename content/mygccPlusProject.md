## MyGCC Plus

MyGCC is the Grove City College site for corework, grades, and other campus activities.

It has some known usability issues, so I wrote a small script to improve some of the low hanging fruit. It is used by dozens of students and a few professors, including the head of the Computer Science department. I've since handed this project off to an underclassman.
