### Checkers

*Fall 2016*

For a class at Frederick Community College called **CIS202 - Computer Science II**, I developed a checkers game as a term project.
Besides simply being a checkers game, the game includes a quite na√Øve AI player.
It also shows statistical data about the game after the fact and stores high scores.
The game was built using the JavaFX library.
