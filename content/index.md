## Hello

Hi! I'm Jake Thurman, and I'm a software developer.
I'm passionate about good, usable software that makes it into the hands of real people.
I love designing simple interfaces for complex tasks.
Going above and beyond the call to action to make something great makes me more excited than anything. 

My hobbies include automating my life, studying the Bible, playing electic guitar, and spending too much money on guitar gear.
Currently, I also spend a lot of time with my bride-to-be, Melissa, preparing for our [wedding](https://www.melissaandjake.com) this October.

### Work Experience

#### HighGear, Inc.

_**Software Development Eningeer**: MAY 2019 - PRESENT_

_**Software Development Intern**: JULY 2014 â€“ MAY 2019_

HighGear is a small company, which has allowed me to work alongside senior developers and gain personal mentorship with them all along the way.
I have played an active role in research, design, planning and estimating, prioritizing with stakeholders, and implementation for numerous features.
I have assisted support many times in a weekly rotation between developers and fixed numerous bugs both in correcting issues for customers and in discovering the root cause so that an issue should not reoccur. 

I have directly worked on many variously sized features used now in production systems. Most notably including A User Experience (UX) project that included user research and redesign of the product from the ground up, the refactoring of legacy Javascript, and C# code, a major documentation re-write and the modernization of many outdated UI elements among many other smaller projects.
