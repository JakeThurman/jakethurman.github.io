## Hello

Hi! I'm Jake Thurman, and I'm a software developer.
I'm passionate about good, usable software.
I love designing simple interfaces for complex tasks, and solving interesting technical problems.

My hobbies include running, biking, studying the Bible, playing electric guitar, and spending time with my wife, Melissa.

### Work Experience

#### HighGear

Website: [https://www.highgear.com/](https://www.highgear.com/)

HighGear is a tool for no-code Workflow management at scale.
HighGear provides the tools to let business users manage their own workflow, without writing a single line of code.


_**Senior Software Engineer**: FEB 2023 - PRESENT_ 

As a senior engineer, software development is still my primary goal.
I find it rewarding to look for a high-quality result, while also finding ways to cut unnecessary corners to deliver quickly.
I help the team and individuals make decisions on business value, technical value, and where to draw the line between them.
I mentor others as needed.
I look to help others learn and improve, and not just solve immediate problems myself.


_**Software Engineer**: MAY 2019 - FEB 2023_

In this role, I was responsible for planning and implementing complex features, and for tackling difficult bugs and performance regressions. 
I was able to work alongside others to design and build features with incomplete requirements, and deliver them on time.


_**Software Intern**: JULY 2014 â€“ MAY 2019_

HighGear is a small company, which has allowed me to work alongside senior developers and gain personal mentorship with them all along the way.
I have played an active role in research, design, planning and estimating, prioritizing with stakeholders, and implementation for numerous features.
I have assisted support many times in a weekly rotation between developers and fixed numerous bugs both in correcting issues for customers and in discovering the root cause so that an issue should not reoccur. 

I have directly worked on many variously sized features used now in production systems. Most notably including multiple User Experience (UX) projects, including user research and a redesign of the product UI from the ground up. Other internship projects included the refactoring of legacy Javascript, and C# code, a major documentation re-write and the modernization of many outdated UI elements, and performance improvement work.
