## Buddies 

[Github Repo](https://github.com/jack-and-the-beans/buddies-ios)

At Grove City, senior computer science students are guided through design of an full application during the fall semester, including extensive User Testing of prototypes created in Adobe XD.
During the Spring my team built the app with extensive consideration of data usage, legal and ethical considerations, design, software architecture, and user experience/usability.

Buddies is an app to connect like-minded people in new stages of life through casual activities.
It includes real-time updates, search, and chat.
We built a minimal admin portal for managing users and activities, handling reports, configuring topics, and watching basic usage metrics.

This project taught me a lot about scope management, project management, work distribution, working effectively in teams, and about acceptance testing among other skills.
