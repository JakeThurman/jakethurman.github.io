For a class at Frederick Community College called **CIS226 - Game Scripting**, I developed a game as a term project.
The game is a basic side-scroller style game built in python on top of the pygame library.
The game includes enemies from spawners, weapons, one-way-walls, bonus-rings, and health just to name a few items.
The player in this game is a stick figure running through one of many easily created worlds part of packages.
These are all easily customizable as well.
The whole game was built with the base purpose of expandability by anyone.
It is one of the things I am most proud of in my computer-science college career.
