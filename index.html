<h3 id="workexperience">Work Experience</h3>
<h4 id="highgear">HighGear</h4>
<p><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://www.highgear.com/">https://www.highgear.com/</a></p>
<p>HighGear is a tool for no-code Workflow management at scale.
HighGear provides the tools to let business users manage their own workflow, without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p><em><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>: FEB 2023 - PRESENT</em> </p>
<p>As a senior engineer, software development is still my primary goal.
I find it rewarding to look for a high-quality result, while also finding ways to cut unnecessary corners to deliver quickly.
I help the team and individuals make decisions on business value, technical value, and where to draw the line between them.
I mentor others as needed.
I look to help others learn and improve, and not just solve immediate problems myself.</p>
<p><em><strong>Software Engineer</strong>: MAY 2019 - FEB 2023</em></p>
<p>In this role, I was responsible for planning and implementing complex features, and for tackling difficult bugs and performance regressions. 
I was able to work alongside others to design and build features with incomplete requirements, and deliver them on time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Software Intern</strong>: JULY 2014 â€“ MAY 2019</em></p>
<p>HighGear is a small company, which has allowed me to work alongside senior developers and gain personal mentorship with them all along the way.
I have played an active role in research, design, planning and estimating, prioritizing with stakeholders, and implementation for numerous features.
I have assisted support many times in a weekly rotation between developers and fixed numerous bugs both in correcting issues for customers and in discovering the root cause so that an issue should not reoccur. </p>
<p>I have directly worked on many variously sized features used now in production systems. Most notably including multiple User Experience (UX) projects, including user research and a redesign of the product UI from the ground up. Other internship projects included the refactoring of legacy Javascript, and C# code, a major documentation re-write and the modernization of many outdated UI elements, and performance improvement work.</p>
