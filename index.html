      <h2 id="hello">Hello</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm Jake Thurman, and I'm a software developer.
I'm passionate about good, usable software that makes it into the hands of real people.
I love designing simple interfaces for complex tasks.
Going above and beyond the call to action to make something great makes me more excited than anything. </p>
<p>My hobbies include automating my life, studying the Bible, playing electic guitar, and spending too much money on guitar gear.
Currently, I also spend a lot of time with my bride-to-be, Melissa, preparing for our <a href="https://www.melissaandjake.com">wedding</a> this October.</p>

<h4 id="highgearinc">HighGear, Inc.</h4>
<p><em><strong>Software Development Eningeer</strong>: MAY 2019 - PRESENT</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Software Development Intern</strong>: JULY 2014 â€“ MAY 2019</em></p>
<p>HighGear is a small company, which has allowed me to work alongside senior developers and gain personal mentorship with them all along the way.
I have played an active role in research, design, planning and estimating, prioritizing with stakeholders, and implementation for numerous features.
I have assisted support many times in a weekly rotation between developers and fixed numerous bugs both in correcting issues for customers and in discovering the root cause so that an issue should not reoccur. </p>
<p>I have directly worked on many variously sized features used now in production systems. Most notably including A User Experience (UX) project that included user research and redesign of the product from the ground up, the refactoring of legacy Javascript, and C# code, a major documentation re-write and the modernization of many outdated UI elements among many other smaller projects.</p>
