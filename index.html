        <p>
            I have worked an intern software developer on Lean BPM software/web app <a href="http://www.jobtraq.com/">JobTraQ</a> since late 2013
            Working on <a href="http://www.jobtraq.com/">JobTraQ</a> I have gained direct experience in all of the following technologies
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>C#/.NET</li>
            <li>MVC</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>JQuery</li>
            <li>JQuery UI</li>
            <li>Git</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I have directly worked on many vairiously sized features deployed now to numerous <a href="http://www.jobtraq.com/our-clients.html">JobTraQ customers</a> worldwide.
            Finally, through working on <a href="http://www.jobtraq.com/">JobTraQ</a> I have gained strong experience in following programming/architecture concepts.
        </p>

            <li>Dependency Injection</li>

            Another instance of my work is a personal project I've written entirely myself which requires no server backend except to host the raw page.
            This goal of the project was to have an advanced, user friendly way to design, and compare pedalboards with the ability to report in various ways on the raw data provided.
            <a href="http://jakethurman.github.io/pedalboard/">You can use it for yourself here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In doing this I hoped mostly to gain strong experience in important technologies, libraries and concepts.
            I had a plan written out before starting of all of the <abbr title="A user story is a tool used in Agile development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective.">User Stories</abbr> I wanted to complete as a part of this project.
            Of course, as with any project some things changed and others were added, but in the end all of the original goals were accomplished.
            <a href="https://github.com/JakeThurman/Pedalboard">You can view the readme and view the the project source on github here.</a>
        </p>
        <p>To summarize, after careful and detailed research of each the full list of libraries I used in this project are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.requirejs.org">RequireJS</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.chartjs.org">Chart.js</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In doing this project I effectively employed asynchronous script loading and dependency injection in javascript through the <a href="http://www.requirejs.org">RequireJS</a> library.
            This helped to keep the code simple, scalable and easily changeable as I went. 
            It also helped me see when I had any unneeded or unused dependencies because they were all in one place at the top of the module.
            Similarly, I often noticed myself getting annoyed at how some modules would be unfocused and doing work that wasn't there job which helped me to effectivly manage the <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OO</abbr> methodology of encapsulation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This use of dependency injection through <a href="http://www.requirejs.org">RequireJS</a> led to simpler testing through the <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> testing library. 
            <a href="http://jakethurman.github.io/pedalboard/tests.html">You can run the tests for yourself here.</a>
            Because of the simple pattern I used to work effectively with <a href="http://www.requirejs.org">RequireJS</a>, the project was able to have near 100% unit test coverage, have little to no global variables or scope leak or interweaving dependencies.
            The full unit test coverage allowed me to make risky changes to core modules without the risk because when something inevitably broke I didn't find out about it from a broken UI (user interface).
            For example, I was able to quickly add complex change-logging functionality to the main "pedalBoardManager" module with only one single issue, a typo, which was caught by a unit tests immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, through this project I learned about javascript unit testing and how it's just as important as in any other language, how and when to consider scalability due to unneeded bulk <span class="italic">(made easy by dependency injection)</span>, designing user interfaces from the ground up and working effectivly with an end goal in mind.

        <p>
            I am a freshman in college (for the 2015-2016 school year). 
            Although because I was homeschooled leading up to college, I was able to attend <a href="http://www.frederick.edu/">my local community college</a> and complete two full semesters worth of education prior to even graduation high school.
            Additionally, in this year I attended as a high schooler, I was able to earn a spot for myself on that year's dean's list
        </p>
        <p>
            From my early education until 5th grade I attended a <a href="http://trinityschooloffrederick.org/">small, local private school</a>, and was there after homeschooled until my high school graduation in May of 2015.
            Because of my homeschooling, for the majority of my schooling I was able to dive deep into programming, english and mathematics getting a head start above where I otherwise would have been.
